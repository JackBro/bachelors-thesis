\subsubsection{Software Based Protection against Changeware}
\cite{changeware} shows a "software-based protection against changeware, i.e. malware with no root/administrator privileges, which performs surreptitious persistent changes to software assets which are not protected by the OS code signature verification mechanism." The main focus of this work is ensuring the integrity of an application X by using white-box-cryptography \cite{wbcrypto}, software diversity \cite{Forrest} and run-time process memory invariant checking. The proposed solution does not rely on specific hardware like, e.g. \emph{Trusted Platform Modules}, and can be applied the vendor of the software. An effective way is presented to prevent automatic attacks on different instances of an application X. This concepts were applied to \emph{Chromium} to prevent changeware from changing the browsers default settings, e.g. the search engine, which will gain the attacker huge revenues.
