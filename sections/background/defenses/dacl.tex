\subsection{Blocking \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} with an Access Control Entry}
\label{sec:dacl}
Most injection techniques call the Windows API function \syscall{OpenProcess} and subsequently \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} to inject code into or modify memory in the remote process. It is not possible to easily intercept these calls from inside a user-mode process, as the process is suspended during the \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} function call and will deadlock the application.

\medskip

To prevent this function call from completing and preventing the exploit, an access control entry (ACE) can be used. An ACE is part of a bigger structure called access control list (ACL), which contains multiple access control entries. Whenever permissions for a windows object is requested, the ACL will get evaluated. The list of windows objects that make use of ACLs can be found in Section \ref{sec:sd}. The ACE limits the process access rights and removes the required permissions to call virtual memory modifying functions like \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} and \syscall{ReadProcessMemory}. The \syscall{OpenProcess} function will then not be able to return a handle with the required permissions and calls to \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} will fail with \syscall{STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED} error code.

\medskip

Implementing this approach works in a test application seen in Appendix \ref{appendix:dacl}, however once added to Google Chrome, Chrome malfunctions and is no longer usable. The reason for that is Chrome's process hierarchy and the dependence on inter process communication with \syscall{WriteProcessMemory} and \syscall{ReadProcessMemory}. Compiling Chromium with a access control entry that denies virtual memory modifying access results in a running Chromium browser that is not fully functioning. The content of the browser is not displayed and opening web pages fail, returning to the current open about:blank page immediately. Therefore a different approach has to be taken to limit virtual memory modification with \syscall{WriteProcessMemory}.
