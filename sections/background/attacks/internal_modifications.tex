A group of attack is internal modifications which is in contrast to external modifications occurring from inside the process virtual memory. As the attacker is already inside the virtual memory, modification is easier and less restricted than the previously shown external modifications. The attacker can make use of existing functions like \syscall{memcpy} or \syscall{memset}, to modifiy the values inside memory, without having to use the indirection via \syscall{WriteProcessMemory}. Besides the present \syscall{mem*} functions, the attacker can also make use of assembly code. Figure \ref{fig:attacks_internal} shows this type of attack. The assembly part outlines the \syscall{mov} instruction, as it is mainly used to detour functions without the usage of exported API functions.

The shown attacks are combined in Figure \ref{fig:attacks}, containing now both parts of attacks, external and internal modifications.
