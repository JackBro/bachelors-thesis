\subsubsection{\syscall{WriteProcessMemory} external modifications}
\gls{WPM} is just like the previously discussed \syscall{SetWindowsHookEx} a function available through the Windows \gls{API}. This function allows to write into the virtual memory of a target process and allows modifying existing data or code. There are several ways to make use of this function. \gls{WPM} is used for \gls{DLL} injection with the \syscall{CreateRemoteThread}, code modification and function detouring.
