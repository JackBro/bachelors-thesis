\subsubsection{DLL Replacement}
The last missing \gls{DLL} injection technique of the given attack tree in Figure~\ref{fig:attacks_external} is \gls{DLL} Replacement (node [1.2.3]). The idea is to replace an existing \gls{DLL} file with a patched or completely different \gls{DLL}, which is possible due to \emph{Windows} internal concepts. Every \gls{DLL} exports functions that can be called from a program. The attacker creates a new \gls{DLL} file, that exports the same functions and internally redirects all calls to the original \gls{DLL} file. Therefore the functionality of the application stays the same and the attack is harder to detect. It is now possible to use one of the exported functions to execute other, new code that performs malicious activities.
