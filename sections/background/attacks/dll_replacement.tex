\subsubsection{DLL Replacement}
The last missing DLL injection technique of the given attack tree in Figure \ref{fig:attacks_external} is DLL Replacement. The idea is to replace an existing DLL file with a patched or completely different DLL, which is possible due to the windows internal concepts. Every DLL exports functions that can be called from a program. The attacker creates a new DLL file, that exports the same functions and internally redirects all calls to the original DLL file. Therefore the functionality of the application stays the same and the attack is harder to detect. It is now possible to use one of the exported functions to execute other, new code that performs malicious activities.
