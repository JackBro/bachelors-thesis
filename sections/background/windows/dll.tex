\subsubsection{Dynamic-link library}
\glsfirst{DLL}s are a fundamental concept of the \emph{Windows} operating system and used in every running application. Programs can make use of \glspl{DLL} by loading them into their virtual memory space and gaining access to the functionality exported by the \glspl{DLL}. Every \gls{DLL} contains an entry point function, which is called whenever the \gls{DLL} is loaded into or unloaded from virtual memory. This function can be used for typical initialization or shutdown behavior. Additionally, most \glspl{DLL} export functions that can be called from outside. This has a major advantage. The exported behavior has to be shipped once, and can be used by many applications, which reduces the overall size of the program and removes unwanted redundancy.
