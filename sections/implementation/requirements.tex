\subsection{Requirements}
This section describes the requirements that the resulting architecture and implementation needs to fulfill. The attacks of Section \ref{sec:attacks} and existing countermeasures of Section \ref{sec:defenses} outline missing defenses for most of the attacks. Therefore, the implementation needs to be able to block DLL injection, code injection and memory modification attacks. The \emph{Windows} environment adds additional prerequisites that need to be considered during design and implementation. The resulting implementation does not need to block actions that occur from kernelmode or users with administrator privileges, because at this privilege level any designed countermeasure can be avoided. This means, that only attacks from usermode without elevated privileges need to be considered. An additional requirement results from this definition. The proposed countermeasures may not be disabled or avoided from other usermode applications.
