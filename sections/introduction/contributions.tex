\subsection{Contribution}
A research about state-of-the art attacks and their associated defenses is done. Attacks and defenses are evaluated against \gls{PMT} and ideas for new defenses are researched and developed. Countermeasures are designed and implemented and the resulting countermeasures are combined in a kernel mode driver, which is evaluated for performance and security.
