In games, especially in online games that are based on a large amount of user-inputs, PMT can be applied to create powerful cheats that are hard to detect. The cheater hereby has to reverse engineer the game once to receive a table of offsets, which can be used later on in modifying mandatory game data. By directly changing the data of the game, Aimbots, Wallhacks and Scripts can be created very easily. The unfair advantage gained by the cheat destroys the games audiences fun and in the long term significantly reduces the number of active players. Nevertheless cheats are used knowing these consequences, as the short term fun is more pleasant for the cheater than properly learning the game play. PMT detection is a crucially important thing in online games like First Person Shooters, as the whole game play relies on user input, but often is very hard to achieve to due lack of knowledge and legal issues.
