\subsection{Problem}
"A browser hijacker is software that modifies the default browser behaviour"\cite{automatedspywarecollection}. That is a  vague definition but reflects on possible candidate of PMT attacks. As a browser is required to view websites, it is used by over three billion \cite{cia} different users, making it a valuable attack target to extract private user information like passwords or credit card information or change default settings like the search engine, to gain additional ad revenues from more visitors. Traffic redirection proves to be very simple with PMT and thus allows to make phising activities look harmless, as they can no longer be distinguished from the original website.
