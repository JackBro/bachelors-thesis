\subsection{Cached function addresses}
The second part of Chrome ELFs features is a built in caching of function addresses of ntdll.dll. All exported functions are stored inside a function lookup table to increase speed and reduce lookup operations of this often used functions. Additionally, the virtual memory space of the function lookup table is set to PAGE\_READONLY, to ensure that this memory can no longer be modified. Again, this adds no security as an attacker (from in or outside) will simply undo this operation and modify the lookup table. Additionally, this feature creates a whole new threat that can be easily used for attacks. Entries of the lookup table receive a new address, making the more complicated API Hooking attacks unneccessary.
