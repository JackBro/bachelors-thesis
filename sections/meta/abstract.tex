\section*{Abstract}
This thesis contributes to the understanding of Process Memory Tampering (PMT) attacks and their existing countermeasures. PMT attacks allow easy manipulation of applications with a low risk of detection. As such they can be applied to any application, e.g. games, browsers or other software. To prevent PMT attacks, new countermeasures are designed and a kernel mode driver is implemented as a proof of concept. Finally the performance overhead of the proposed solution is measured and the resulting security from this implementation is analyzed.
