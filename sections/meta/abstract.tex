\section*{Abstract}
This thesis contributes to the understanding of Process Memory Tampering attacks and their existing countermeasures. Further, new countermeasures are designed and a kernelmode driver is implemented as a proof of concept. Finally the performance overhead of the proposed solution is measured and the resulting security from this implementation is analyzed.
