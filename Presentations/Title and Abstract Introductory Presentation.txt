Title:
	Overview of illegal memory modifications - Attacks and Defenses

Abstract:
	The presentation "Overview of illegal memory modifications - Attacks and Defenses" focuses on Process Memory Tampering (PMT), 
	which has always been existent and as such can be exploited easily for malicious activities. It is very commonly used in game cheating
	but can be applied to any application running on a windows computer, e.g. Browser Hijacking of Google Chrome.
	Possible attacks and defenses are shown and existing defenses like ASLR, DEP and MIC are evaluated against PMT.
	The results of the current research will be extended into a thesis about PMT Detection focusing on Google Chrome and Browser Hijacking
	on a Windows 7 machine.
